This repository demonstrates a common but often frustrating issue with Firebase Authentication: silent failures and unclear error messages. The `authBug.js` file showcases a scenario where authentication fails without providing informative error messages, making debugging challenging. The solution, provided in `authSolution.js`, demonstrates how to implement robust error handling to catch and manage these situations effectively, providing the user with informative feedback.  The solution involves adding comprehensive error handling, which includes checking for specific error codes and providing user-friendly messages based on the type of authentication failure.
